%% HydroSight - _Model Calibration GUI Tab_

%% Overview
% The _Model Calibration_ tab allows the global calibration of constructed
% time-series models. The global optima can be identified as a single best 
% parameter set or a population of parameter sets, which allows quantification
% of the parameter and simulation nonlinear uncertainty. For the former, use the calibration 
% methods _CMA-ES_ or _SP-UCI_ (a variant on Shuffled Complex Evolution). For 
% uncertainty estimation, use the metthod _DREAM_. Finally, if you are 
% unfamiliar with global calibration, see <doc_Calibration.html here> for details. 
%
% The time-series models can be challenging to calibrate
% and it often requires 100,000+ model runs. To reduce the calibration
% time, use a PC with many cores and for the TFN models consider limiting 
% the years of input forcing data prior to the first water level observation to ~20 years. 
%
% The calibration time can also be reduced by offloading the calibration to
% a high performance cluster. This allows numerous models to be calibrated
% simultaneously. Curently, this is a _beta_ feature and is limited to Linux
% clusters using PBS queue system and _mpiexec.hydra_ and with matlab 
% >=2014b installed. To offload the
% calibration, click on the button _HPC Offload_ (only available when
% runnign from within Matlab). Once the calibration is complete, click on
% _HPC Retrieval_ to inport the results back into your project.
% Additionally, the model TFN time-series model can also be calibrated
% using Xeon Phi co-processor cards. If a co-processor card is available on the
% cluster then the numerical intergration step of the TFN model will be
% undertaken using the co-processor card(s). To use this features, the
% cluster will also require the Intel compiler ICC >=2013.
%
% Once a model is calibrated the following tasks can be undertaken: 
%
% * simulation of the groundwater head.
% * split-sample evaluation of the calibration using observation data not
% included in the calibration.
% * calculation of various performance statistics and a variogram
%  of the residuals.
%
% The screenshot below illustrates the main features of the tab. Specifically:
%
% * The left-hand table lists the bores that have been constructed and can be calibrated.
% * Unique calibration setting can be defined to each row of the table.
% * Detailed calibration results are shown in the right-hand pane. The
% drop-down menu (see screenshot) lists the available results to
% display.
% * Calibration performance metrics are listed in the right-hand columns of
% the table. These allow the efficient identification of the acceptable
% models or the identification of the best model structure for a bore.
% * Buttons above the table allow export of the table or import of a .csv file.

%% Getting Started
%
% To calibrate a time-series model, complete the following steps:
%
% # Locate the required model to calibrate within the _Model Label_ column.
% # Input a start and end date for the calibration. Note, by default these
% dates are set to the start and end date of the observed hydrograph.
% # Select a calibration scheme and input the required one calibration setting (see
% the tool tips for details, or click <doc_Calibration.html here>.
% # Select the models to be calibrated using the left-hand tick boxes.
% # Click on the button _Calibrate Selected Models_ to calibrate the
% models. The progress is displayed in the column _Calib. Status_.
% # Review the calibration results using the performance statistics within 
% the table and the detailed results within the right-hand pane.

%% Inputs
%
% The following inputs are available for this tab. The *bold* inputs are required:
%
% * *_Calib. Start Date_*: The start date for selecting water level
% observations to be used in the calibration. Observations prior to this
% date will be used in the evaluation calculations.
% * *_Calib. End Date_*: The end date for selecting water level
% observations to be used in the calibration. Observations after this
% date will be used in the evaluation calculations.
% * *_Calib. Method_*: The global calibration method. See
% <doc_Calibration.html here> for details of the available methods.
% * *_Calib. Setting_*: A setting for the selected global calibration
% method that controls the rigor of the global calibration.

%% Outputs
%
% The following outputs are presented within the table:
%
% * _Calib. Status_ : the status of the model calibration is
% displayed within the table. Error messages for the calibration are also
% displayed.
% * _Calib. Period CoE_ : The coefficient of efficiency calculated from
% observations within the calibration period. Note, 1 denotes a perfect fit
% to the observation data, 0 denotes a fit equal to that from just using the
% mean observed water level, and <0 denotes a fit worse than using the mean
% observed water level.
% * _Eval Period Unbiased CoE_ : The unbiased coefficient of efficiency calculated from
% observations outside of the calibration start and end dates. The unbiased
% term denotes that the calculation was undertaken after the simulated water
% level was adjusted to have an equal mean to the mean observed water level
% during the evaluation period.
% * _Calib. Period AIC_ : The Akaike information criterion during the calibration period. It is a measure of
% model performance that accounts for the number of model parameters. It is
% useful for comparing different models applied to the same data. A lower
% AIC denotes a more parsimonious model (see
% <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion here> for
% details. Note, the AIC is calculated using the least squares estimate of
% the liklihood function.
% * _Eval. Period AIC_ : The Akaike information criterion during the evaluation period.
%
% In addition to the above table of outputs, detailed outputs can be shown
% in the right-hand pane. The available outputs are detailed below. To access these outputs, 
% select the required output from the right-hand drop-down menu and then place the cursor 
% in a cell for the required model.
%
% * _Data & residuals_ : table of estimated water level and noise. The table
% can be selected and copied and pasted into, say, Excel.
% * _Parameter values_ : the optimal calibrated parameter values.
% * _Derived Variables_ : derived variables specific to the model type.
% * _Simulation time series plot_ : plot of the simulated and observed
% head.
% * _Residuals time series plot_ : scatter plot of the observed minus
% estimated water level. These should be randomly distributed, have a mean
% of zero and have no temporal trend.
% * _Histogram of calib. residuals_ : histogram of observed minus
% estimated water level during the calibration period. The distribution should have a mean of zero and
% have a narrow range.
% * _Histogram of eval. residuals_ : histogram of observed minus
% estimated water level during the evaluation period. The distribution should have a mean of zero and
% have a narrow range.
% * _Scatter plot of obs. vs model_ : plots the calibration period observed
% vs simulated water level. The points should be centred around the 1:1
% line and have a similar spread along the 1:1 line.
% * _Scatter plot of residuals vs obs_ : plots the observed water level 
% vs residuals. Ideally, the residuals should show no relationship with
% the observed water level.
% * _Variogram of residuals_ : plots the temporal correlation in the
% residuals and fits an exponential model to the experimental variogram.
% Ideally, the fitted variogram curve should approach its maximum value
% after a short temporal duration.
