To achieve reproducible and reliable calibration results some knowledge of calibration is required. This page provides a brief overview of global calibration and details the calibration methods available within the toolbox.</p><h2>Global Calibration Concepts<a name="2"></a></h2><p>Global calibration uses a numerical algorithm to minimise the difference between an observed data set, in this case the observed hydrograph, and a model of the observed hydrograph. To achieve this, the difference between the observed and modelled data is reduced to a single number called the <i>objective function</i>, which can be as simple as the difference between the square of the observed data and modelled data at each time point and then summed.</p><p>In calibrating the model, the aim is to find the very lowest objective function value and this is achieved by adjusting the model's parameter. Importantly, when the parameters are systematically changed (for example, across a 2-D grid of values for two parameters) and the objective function is calculated at each combination of the two parameters the result is often a smooth surface of model error, called a <i>response surface</i>, and similar to a topographic map.</p><p>To illustrate these concepts, the animation below shows a grid of two model parameters, <i>x1</i> and <i>x2</i>, and green contours of the model error, which are similar to elevation contours of a topographic map. In this example, the contours show many <i>basins</i> or <i>troughs</i> each represented by small circles, that is <i>local optima</i>. Additionally, the <i>deepest</i> optima are those in the bottom-left of the figure. The aim of a numerical global calibration scheme is to find the deepest optima, i.e. the optima with the very lowest possible model error.</p><p>Many numerical global calibration schemes find the parameter values giving the lowest error by using a population of parameter sets (i.e. many points within the response surface) that <i>evolve</i> toward the global optima using a processes of similar to natural selection and mutation. Hence, the methods are referred to as <i>evolutionary</i> methods. This is illustrated in the figure below where the initial population of points are randomly distributed over the entire parameter region and they evolve toward the global optima in the bottom left.</p><p>An important aspect of global calibration is that the solutions are very rarely 100% reproducible. That is, if the calibration is re-ran three times it is not guaranteed to converge to the same optima each time. This is illustrated in the figure below where one of the runs converges to an optima at <i>x1</i> ~= 1.5 and <i>x2</i> ~= 0.5 while the other two runs converge to the true global optima at <i>x1</i> ~= 0.5 and <i>x2</i> ~= 1.5. This occurs because global calibration methods rely on randomness in the initial parameter sampling and in the evolutionary process and so each time the scheme is ran it can converge to a different optima. Therefore for all but the most trivial of problems the calibration solution cannot be confirmed to be the global optima. The probability of finding the global optima can however be inferred by re-running the calibration scheme multiple times and reviewing the results. If after running the calibration, say, 10 times the objective function value achieved on the first run is not bettered then it is likely the global optima has been located.</p><p>For these reasons, applying a global calibration scheme is more complex than just turning it <i>on</i> and pressing <i>go</i>. All schemes have settings, such as the number of initial points, that need to be <i>tuned</i>. Often this is done to increase the probability that the global optima has been located but it comes at the expense of computational efficiency. To illustrate, a time-series model with, say, 5 parameters requires that a a five dimensional rectangle be searched for the global optima. Using the default settings for the calibration scheme may require time-series model to be run, say, 10,000 times. However, if it is very important that the global optima be located then more rigorous settings may require &gt;100,000 model runs to converge to an optima. Furthermore, different schemes may perform different and so multiple runs may be required using different schemes. In summary, global calibration must be undertaken in the context of the importance of the problem being modelled and the available computational resources.</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Estimation_of_Distribution_Algorithm_animation.gif" alt=""> </p><p>Figure Attribution: Created by Pasimi.

%% Overview
% 
% Global calibration is a fundamental feature of the toolbox. To achieve

% details the calibration methods available within the toolbox.

%% Global Calibration Concepts
%
% Global calibration uses a numerical algorithm to minimise the difference
% between an observed data set, in this case the observed hydrograph, and a
% model of the observed hydrograph. To achieve this, the difference between the
% observed and modelled data is reduced to a single number called the
% _objective function_, which can be as simple as the difference between the
% square of the observed data and modelled data at each time point and then summed.

% value and this is achieved by adjusting the model's parameter.
% Importantly, when the parameters are systematically changed (for example,
% across a 2-D grid of values for two parameters) and the objective function is
% calculated at each combination of the two parameters the result is often
% a smooth surface of model error, called a _response surface_, and similar
% to a topographic map. 
%
% To illustrate these concepts, the animation below shows a grid of two 
% model parameters, _x1_ and _x2_, and green contours of the model error,
% which are similar to elevation contours of a topographic map. In this example, 
% the contours show many _basins_ or _troughs_ each represented by small circles, that is

% optima using a processes of similar to natural selection and mutation. Hence, the
