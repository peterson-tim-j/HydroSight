This file documents changes to HydroSight from version 1.2.6 onwards.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

13 Feb 2016:
* doIRFconvolution.c: Simpsons 3/8 integration was fund to produce numerical artefacts at daily simulations. This is due to the switching of the integraion for even and odd number of convolution days. This was overcome by use of the Simpsons extended rule. NOTE: the Xeon Phi verion has NOT yet been recompiled.

20 Feb 2017:
* HydroSightModel:integrateData(): local search procedure for kriging edit to ensure points both sides of the estimation time point are included in the temporal kriging.

2 Mar 2017:
* HydroSightModel:integrateData(): Universal kriging equations changed from variogram values to covariances.
* HydroSightModel:calibrateModel(): residuals converted to single data type only when there are >1 parameter sets.

17 Mar 2017
* doDataQualityAnalysis(): rate of change analysis edits to look at rate of change forward in time. Originally a bug caused it to look backward.

17 Mar 2017
* HydroSight_GUI. Version number updated to 1.2.7

22 May 2017
* Error fixed in estimate of residual noise, sigma_n, for TFN and exp. models. It is now derived using the innovations, not residuals.
* Outlier detection now uses an estimate of the residual noise that is a function of time i.e the time between prior observation and the point being assesed.

4 August 2017
* pumpingRate_SAestimation() updated and SP-UCI code and model_TFN.m edited to allow downscaling of infrequent (>daily) groundwater pumping data to daily, weeekly or monthly rates.

16 August 2017
* Bug fixed with SCE-UI while-loop for invalid params.

18 August 2017
* responseFunction_Pearsons.getParameters_physicalLimit() upper limit for 'A' reduced to log(1/1000) in an attempt to improve est. of free drainage.

18 August 2017
* Alpha version of a new calibration results GUI. It now allows the plotting of the forcing data.

24 August 2017
* Alpha version of a new calibration results GUI extended to handle MCMC outputs and plot model specific outputs eg weighting fucntion plots.
* Bug fixed - deleting data preparation rows now deletes the actual model object.
* Boot time significantly increased by removing use of createtable(). Tables can no longer be sorted.
* Alpha version of a new calibration results GUI edited to work with exponential model ('get' functions for forcing data and derived data moved into HydroSightModel())
* Alpha version of a new calibration results GUI tabs turn on/off when relevant data is/is not available.

1 September 2017
* Tool tips added to selected TFN weighting function and derived weighting function option tables.
* Parameter bounds added to TFN Pearson's weighting function GUI table.
* climateTransform_soilMoistureModels() and climateTransform_soilMoistureModels_2layer() k_sat parameter bounds reduced to reflect sensible soil values.
* climateTransform_soilMoistureModels() and climateTransform_soilMoistureModels_2layer() gamma parameter chnnged to have log10() transform (as had been stated in class description).
* Bug fixed in pumpingRate_SAestimation.m that sometimes caused errors on last day of forcing.
* The approach for SPUCI calibration of models with stochastic forcing was changed to update the stochastic forcing only prior to the updating of a complex. The change reduced the calibration time.

15 September 2017
* Bug fixed in DimEst.m causing a while loop to loop indefinitely.
* Bug fixed in responseFunction_Pearsons.m plotting.
* Back transfored parameters returned by climateTransform_soilMoistureModels_v2() and climateTransform_soilMoistureModels_2layer_v2().
* New classes climateTransform_soilMoistureModels_v2() and climateTransform_soilMoistureModels_2layer_v2() added that constrains the simulated ET.
* GUI derived parameters plot x-axis label trimmed.

15 March 2018
* Bug fixed on ODE solver for forcingTransform_soilMoisture.c that is likely to reduce the estimated recharge from models using climateTransform_soilMoistureModels_v2().
* The calibration GUI now allows setting of most calibrations settings for all methods and prints the command window output to the GUI.
* 'Calibration setting' column removed from the calibration table.
* Error fixed in the estimation of effective precip and the runoff rate in climateTransform_soilMoistureModels().
* All forcing fluxes from calibrated models can be explored and plotted over a user-set time-step and period.
* Data can now be exported from all results tables by right clicking on the table.
* The selection of pumping bores for pumpingRate_SAestimation() downscaling is now aided by a 'wizard'. The wizard selects pumping bores within a user set distance of the obs bore.
* Models using pumpingRate_SAestimation() can now be calibrated with an evaluation period. Note, the evaluation period should have daily metered usage.

29 March 2018
* Calibration window, SCU tab, extended to allow the input of an upper and lower maximum number of complexes (ngs). This is useful when calibrating many models each having a different number of parameters. 
* All inputs within the calibration window now allow the input of a empty value. When so done, the default will be used, specifically the seed value will be random. This is useful for calibrating many models each with a different initial seed.
* Within climateTransform_soilMoistureModels(), and all inheriting soil models, the soil moisture capacity parameter physical limit was reduced from inf to 1000 mm. This was done to improve calibration run time and to constrain the solution to a plausible range.
* Bug fixed in copying rows within the GUI.
* Bug fixed in DREAM.m that caused the calibration output text to not be shown in the calibration window.
* Wait box removed from DREAM.m 

10 April 2018
* GUI now allows the importing of time-series models (not data-preparation models) from another project. 
* Calibration on a HPC cluster is now working with the GUI calibration window. Note, offloading calibration to a cluster is only available when HydroSight is run from within Matlab.
* HPC calibration now supports the SLURM HPC system. 

1 May 2018
* Bug fixed in pumpingRate_SAestimation() that caused a new downscaled time series to only be applied when an SP-UCI calibration evolution completed. The outcome of this is that the pumping downscaling is now better 'tuned' to the obs. hydrograph.
* Computational efficiency of pumpingRate_SAestimation.updateStochForcingData() is improved by replacing a for-loop with a vectorised form.
* climateTransform_soilMoistureModels.setTransformedForcing() is now only undertaken when the soil parameters change. This was undertaken to improve computational efficiency and should not change the results from any model.
* Calibration scheme SP-UCI tweaked to produce more efficient calibration when stochastic forcing data is being derived (eg from pumpingRate_SAestimation)
* Bug fixed in HydroSight_GUI() that caused model construction to crash when (somewhow) there are duplicate model labels in the calibration table.

22 May 2018
* Bug fixed in calibration scheme SP-UCI when calibration when stochastic forcing data. The issue resolved was that after each evolutionary loop the objective function value was not updated using the final stochastic forcing. This caused instability in the calibration.
* Formatting of GUI tool tips reformatted.

23 May 2018
* GUI help moved to using that at https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/HydroSight/wiki
* MEX .C files recompiled for Windows.

22 May 2018
* Bug fixed in calibration scheme SP-UCI when calibration when stochastic forcing data. The issue resolved was that after the end of each complex, the final stochastic forcing was not returned. This caused the stochastic forcing to not be updated.
* Calibration GUI now has a progress bar.
* Calibration GUI now modal ie the user can't switch to other HydroSight windows.

13 Aug 2018
* Feature added to GUI opetions for pumpingRate_SAestimation() allowing the wizard selected bores to be pushed to the pumping weighting component.
* Bug fixed in calibration GUI daily data results table. Now the day of the month is correct.
* Significant impovement in the calibration time of models containing pumpingRate_SAestimation(). 

15 Aug 18
* Bug fixed in model_TFN GUI for pushing transformed forcing data names to weightimg functions.
* Dropdown option for multi-model removed becasue this feature is has been delayed.

16 Aug 2018
* Build_C_code.m added to build mex functions. NOTE, see file for compiler optimisations tips.
* MEX functions compiled using -0fast and -03 optimisation (Linux/windows respectively)
* Bug fixed in building models within an otherwise empty project.

23 Aug 2018
* calibGUI_interface.m added to GIT. This class was added to HydroSight GUI in mid-2018 but unfortunately I forgot to add it to GIT.
* findjobj() can be VERY slow in linux. This Mathworks File Exchange function was updated to the v1.50.0.0, which is reported as being faster.

4 October 2018
* Daily integrated ET and drainage results and daily mass balance approximations are now provided by climateTransform_soilMoistureModels() and climateTransform_soilMoistureModels_2layer (and V2 versions). This was added because the standard aforementioned fluxes are instantaneous values at the end of each day and are not daily sums. 

12 Nov 2018
* Bug fixed in data quality analysis algorithm that caused outlier detection analysis to crash.
* Bug fixed in quality analysis GUI to ensure variable field names can be created from the bore ID.
* Bugs fixed in appending quality analysis GUI table data.
* GUI for quality analysis tweaked to allow for time-step of seconds.

23 Nov 2018
* All plots can be exported to a PNG image file using a new icon within the GUI.

20 Dec 2018
* Requirement for instalaltion of the Financial Toolbox (for use of year.m, month.m, day.m etc) has been removed by the addition of package specific files year.m, month.m, day.m, minute.m and second.m
* The default number of standard deviations for the auto-outlier detetection has been increased from 3 to 4.

28 Feb 2019
* GUI become disfunctional under Windows 10. This was resolved by changing the GUI construction from using https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27758-gui-layout-toolbox to https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox
* The code for GUI construction (https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox) has been removed from the package. For those running HydroSight from within Matlab, the user must now install the toolbox from the prior link.

5 April 2019
* Mex file for Windows OS (forcingTransform_soilMoisture.mexa64) added.
* Error message for missing above file shortened to be visible within the GUI. 
* GUI on Windows 10 can be incorrectly built. In an attempt to reslove this, HydroSight.m tries to use the Matlab add-on "GUI Layout Toolbox" but only if installed.
* Bug fixed. Starting a new project now allows the constrcution table to have >0 rows.
* Version number updated

16 April 2019
* Bug fixed in listing TFN weighting input data types. 

9 May 2019
* Bug fixed in forward and backward data preparation which cases this feature to fail
* Bug fixed in editing outlier points which caused the plot to no longer be displayed.

29 May 2019
* Bug fixed that caused the GUI to not open in matlab 2018b+. Importantly, when using 2018b+ the plot zoom etc tools now appear within the plot, not within the toolbar (see GitHub issue #40).
* Bug fixed that caused the Pearson's fucntion lag time to the peak weighting to be incorrect (see GitHub issue #41).
* Slider added that allows efficient changing of the GUI table the width (see GitHub issue #42).
* Bug fixed that caused duplicate site ID names within the coordinates file to cause an unhandled errors (see GitHub issue #43).
* GUI left hand panels changed to fixed height panels.
* The function which loads the GUI now reports unhandled errors (Hydrosight.m).
* The name of the tab 'Date Preparation' has been changed to 'Outlier Removal'
* Bug fixed in example_TFN_model.m.

30 May 2019
* Bug fixed in offloading models from RAM to HDD. This feature now works.

19 June 2019
* Bug fixed in building model_TFN derived weighting model (using the GUI).

11 July 2019
* The "climateTransform_soilMoistureModels", and the varients for 2 layers and with the constraint on soil ET, have been changed to use 3 
  subdaily steps when solving the soil moisture differential equations. This was undertaken because estimation of the flux over a day (rather
  than the instantaneous estimate of the flux) cannot be reliabilty integrated. The substeps now provide 4 values per day, which are 
  numerically integrated (using trapazoidal rule) to produce a daily flux that is then used with the daily timestep weighting function. 
  This approach to estimating fluxes produced much lower soil model mass balance errors, but achieving such required a reduction in the ODE 
  solver error tolerance from 1e-2 to 1e-6. Other relevant change include: (i) removal of the fluxes with the "_integrated" suffix - all are 
  now integrated; (ii) "interflow" flux has ben removed becuase of complications in estimating the runoff with multiple layers, (iii) the 
  "effectice precipitation" is now listed as a flux (iv) when the deep layer of a two layer model fills, runoff is produced from  it.
* Bug fixed in the filtering of flux data by a start and end date.
* Model examples re-run to reflect changes to the soil moisture model.
