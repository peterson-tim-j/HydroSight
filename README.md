HydroSight - _A toolbox for data-driven hydrogeological insights_
==============================

HydroSight is a highly flexible statistical toolbox for deriving quantitative insights value from groundwater monitoring data. It includes a powerful graphical interface for analying 100s of groundwater observation bores, allowing data-driven:

* decomposition of a groundwater hydrograph into individual drivers, such as climate and pumping or climate ([Shapoori et al., 2015a](https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/HydroSight/blob/master/documentation/html/papers/Shapoori_2015A.pdf)) and landuse change ([Peterson and Western, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1029/2017WR021838)).
* estimation of aquifer hydraulic properties from the hydrograph ([Shapoori et al., 2015c](https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/HydroSight/blob/master/documentation/html/papers/Shapoori_2015C.pdf), [Peterson et al., in-press](https://doi.org/10.1111/gwat.12946))
* statistical identification of the major groundwater processes ([Shapoori et al., 2015b](https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/HydroSight/blob/master/documentation/html/papers/Shapoori_2015B.pdf)).
* interpolation or extrapolation of the observed hydrographs to a regular time step ([Peterson & Western, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1029/2017WR021838).
* simulation of groundwater head under different climate or, say, pumping scenarios.
* numerical identification of hydrograph monitoring errors and outliers ([Peterson et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10040-017-1660-7)).
