_HydroSight_ is a highly flexible statistical toolbox for quantitative hydrogeological insights. It comprises of a powerful groundwater hydrograph time-series modelling and simulation framework plus a data quality analysis module. Multiple models can be built for one bore, allowing statistical identification of the dominant processes, or 100's of bores can be modelled to quantify aquifer heterogeneity. This flexibility allows many novel applications such as:

1. Separations of the impacts from pumping and drought over time.
2. Probabilistic estimation of aquifer hydraulic properties.
3. Estimation of the impacts of re-vegetation on groundwater level.
4. Exploration of groundwater management scenarios.
5. Interpolation and extrapolation irregularly observed hydrograph at a daily time-step.

The toolbox can be used from a highly flexible and stand-alone graphical user interface ([available here](https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/HydroSight/releases)) or programmatically from within Matlab 2014b (or later). 

### What's New
The next release of the stand alone application is out! It contains some exciting new features:
- Extend examination of calibrated and simulation model fluxes, eg rations such as monthly free drainage / precip.
- Details documentation of model construction and calibration status.
- Outlier detection analysis is significantly faster to run on 100s of bores.
- "Cite Project" menu item added to allow efficient referencing.
- Many bug and annoyances fixed making it more efficient to build and examine models.

### How many use _HydroSight_? 
The number of downloads per releases are availabe at [Git Hub Release Statistics](https://somsubhra.github.io/github-release-stats/?username=peterson-tim-j&repository=HydroSight&page=1&per_page=5). As of August 2022, there had been >1,200 downloads. Also, 17 users have forked this project to make their only modifications.

### Getting Started
To begin using the stand-alone application, simply download and install the above Windows 64bit executable  (available [here](https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/HydroSight/releases)). 

Next, visit the [project wiki help](https://github.com/peterson-tim-j/HydroSight/wiki) to explore the graphical interface and types of models.
